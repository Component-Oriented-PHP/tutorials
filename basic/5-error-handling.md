# Error Handling

Great! Now that we have a working router, let's add some error handling to our application.

In the front controller (`public/index.php`), change the following:

```php
// from
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

// to
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload'; # we are creating a deliberate typo
```

> ðŸ”¥NOTE: We are intentionally creating a typo here.

Open the browser and see what happens. You should see a "This page isnâ€™t working" 500 error. Now, we know what the problem is. But what if we did not? This is where error handling comes in handy.

Just above composer require, add the following:

```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', '1');

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload'; # keep the typo
```

Now go check the browser again. Now you should be seeing something like this:

```bash
Warning: require_once(I:\SOFTWARE\cophp\basic-application\public/../vendor/autoload): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory in I:\SOFTWARE\cophp\basic-application\public\index.php on line 12
```

This clearly states that the file we are requiring does not exist. Fix the typo and re-check, the error should be gone now.
