# Basic Tutorial

The basic tutorial is more of a modern rewrite of the [original tutorial by Patrick Louys & contributors](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial). You will find more exciting stuff in the advanced tutorial. Start below.

I have brought major changes to the original tutorial, even adding a few new chapters and removing a few, moving some to the advanced tutorial. The goal is to keep it simple and focused on the essentials of building a web application without a framework (and without reinventing the wheel).

## Scope of Application We Are Building in This Tutorial

The goal is to teach you how to glue components together to build applications. We will be building a very simple application where in you can write content as markdown, render list of pages on homepage, and view each page. That's it.

## Notes

- This tutorial won't teach you PHP. It teaches you how to glue composer packages to create web apps.
- Don't just read. Code alongside the lessons. [Final output for this basic tutorial is here](https://github.com/Component-Oriented-PHP/basic-application).
