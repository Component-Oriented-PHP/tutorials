# Wrapup

Alright, you have reached the end of my (our) basic tutorial. Congrats!

Take a moment to appreciate what you've learned:

- **Dependency management** with Composer and understanding the difference between libraries and services
- **Modern PHP practices** including strict typing, proper namespacing, and PSR standards
- **Dependency injection** and why it matters for testable, maintainable code
- **Configuration management** that's both flexible and secure
- **Routing systems** that can handle complex applications
- **Template engines** for clean separation of concerns
- **Markdown parsing** with configurable, extensible architecture

You now understand the building blocks that frameworks are made of. When you do use a framework, you'll appreciate what it's doing under the hood.

Up until this point, everything you went through was just a modern rewrite of Patrick's original 12 markdown long tutorial with some changes including newer chapters, different packages, etc. I also skipped a few chapters I did not think was so important.

And this is all I wanted to teach you, how to approach PHP development without frameworks by using pre-existing packages on packagist/composer.

But this isn't really the end, if you don't want it to. Because I have added an even advanced tutorial (Chk Chk, it's free don't worry; no paywalls ðŸ¤‘) . This tutorial is far more advanced and heart wrenching if you are a beginner.

*But leaving after having completed the basic tutorial is fine too. Go build something with what you've learned!*

You can read the [advanced tutorial here](../advanced/README.md) if you feel like Tom Cruise on a Mission Impossible.

*Remember: The best way to solidify this knowledge is to build something. Start small, but start building.*

Have fun!
