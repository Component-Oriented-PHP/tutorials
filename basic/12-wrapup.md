# Wrapup

Alright, you have reached the end of my (our) basic tutorial.

Up until this point, everything you went through was just a modern rewrite of Patrick's original 12 markdown long tutorial with some changes including newer chapters, different packages, etc. I also skipped a few chapters I did not think was so important.

And this is all I wanted to teach you, how to approach PHP development without frameworks by using pre-existing packages on packagist/composer.

But this isn't really the end, if you don't want it to. Because I have added an even advanced tutorial (Chk Chk, it's free don't worry; no paywalls ðŸ¤‘) . This tutorial is far more advanced and heart wrenching if you are a beginner. *But leaving after having completed the basic tutorial is fine too.*

You can read the [advanced tutorial here](../advanced/README.md).
