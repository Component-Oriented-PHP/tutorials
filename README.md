# So, You Wanna Build PHP Apps Without a Full-Blown Framework? (The Component Oriented Way!)

_TLDR: This tutorial teaches intermediate to advanced PHP developers how to build applications using standalone Composer packages instead of full frameworks. Learn component-oriented architecture by assembling existing libraries into cohesive applications. Two difficulty levels available: Basic (foundation concepts) and Advanced (complex implementations). Requires solid PHP fundamentals and OOP knowledge._

Alright, let's get one thing straight: if you're brand new to PHP, still figuring out what a `<?php` tag does, or if "Object-Oriented Programming" sounds like a cult you accidentally joined, this tutorial series might just chew you up and spit you out. (No hard feelings, we all start somewhere. Go get your PHP basics down, then come back. We'll have tea... or something stronger.)

In production, use established frameworks unless you have specific constraints (that frameworks can't handle) or learning goals. Use any framework that you want - Symfony, Laravel, Yii, CI4, Laminas, Mezzio or any other that you and your team feel like using. It's rarely an issue in good hands.

**However**, _I wanted to give Patrick's original [No-Framework tutorial](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial) a modern update, so I created this tutorial for anyone interested in learning "how to develop without frameworks by glueing together existing composer packages". This tutorial is intended to teach you how to develop applications in PHP without relying on a framework if you ever feel the urge to move out, or migrate, or whatever your goal is._

I use this approach in most of my personal projects and Symfony/CI4 for most of my business ones.

There are two versions of the tutorial:

(A) Basic one - for noobs (or everyone)

(B) Advanced one - for experts/intermediate players or the ones who have been through the Basic one (this one is so heart-wrenching that three developers have already rage-quit and gone back to WordPress. You've been warned; just kidding, LOL).

And one last thing... it is not an easy tutorial to follow if you are bad at PHP (doesn't matter if you're good at frameworks). People get so much into the framework ecosystem that they forget they are PHP devs, not framework devs. So, if you're not good at PHP, you would need to keep your eyes and mind open... because the tutorial is not easy (though I have made all possible attempts to keep it easy to follow; I remember having difficulty following Patrick's original tutorial, so I added this).
