# Static Site Generator

This tutorial teaches you how to create your own static site generator, similar to Jekyll or Hugo using PHP. We will use no frameworks, neither start from scratch. We will combine existing composer packages to get a working static site generator.

Remember that this will be a CLI app, not a web app. But, I highly recommend you go through the [basic tutorial](./../basic/) first to get a hang of the concepts. We won't use all the concepts taught there, but what's the harm?

**WORK IN PROGRESS**.
